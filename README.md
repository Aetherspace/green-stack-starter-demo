# Universal Expo + Next.js App Router Starter

A minimal starter for a universal Expo + Next.js app with their respective app routers.

It's a good starting point if you want to:

- âœ… make use of app-dir file based routing in expo and next.js
- âœ… have a minimal monorepo setup with Typescript but no monorepo tool yet
- âœ… leave all other tech choices for e.g. styling, dbs, component libs, etc. up to you

> This template repo is the result of a frequent exercise where I attempt to recreate the core functionality of the [FullProduct.dev Starterkit](https://github.com/Aetherspace/green-stack-starter) from scratch. I usually do this using the latest recommended expo + next.js starter from the Expo docs. This helps me see whether the setup and config for FullProduct.dev can be further simplified. Also handy to notice where issues occur and how to fix them.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see your **Next.js 14** app on web.

Install and/or open the [Expo Go](https://expo.io/client) app on your phone and scan the QR code to test your **Expo SDK 51** app on mobile.

## Documentation

All docs for this basic Universal Starter can be found at [universal-base-starter-docs.vercel.app](https://universal-base-starter-docs.vercel.app/)

## Alternative Universal App starters

See [How to choose cross-platform tech](https://dev.to/codinsonn/why-use-react-native-over-flutter-a-recap-57b0) on dev.to for our more detailed list of alternatives.

**Our main recommendation for a more opinionated, more automated and extensible Universal Expo + Next.js starter to [move fast and build things](https://dev.to/codinsonn/how-to-compete-with-elons-twitter-a-dev-perspective-4j64) will always be FullProduct.dev ðŸ‘‡**
