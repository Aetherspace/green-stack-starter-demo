# Universal Expo + Next.js App Router Starter

A minimal starter for a universal Expo + Next.js app with their respective app routers.

It's a good starting point if you want to:

- ‚úÖ make use of app-dir file based routing in expo and next.js
- ‚úÖ have a minimal monorepo setup with Typescript but no monorepo tool yet
- ‚úÖ leave all other tech choices for e.g. styling, dbs, component libs, etc. up to you

> This template repo is the result of a frequent exercise where I attempt to recreate the [FullProduct.dev](https://fullproduct.dev) Universal App Starterkit from scratch. I usually do this using the latest recommended expo + next.js starter from the Expo docs. This helps me see whether the setup and config for the Universal App Starter can be simplified. Also handy to notice where issues occur and how to fix them.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see your **Next.js 14** app on web.

Install and/or open the [Expo Go](https://expo.io/client) app on your phone and scan the QR code to test your **Expo SDK 51** app on mobile.

## Documentation

All docs for this basic Universal Starter can be found at [universal-base-starter-docs.vercel.app](https://universal-base-starter-docs.vercel.app/) and are built from the `with/mdx-docs-nextra` branch.

## Alternative Universal App starters

See [How to choose cross-platform tech](https://dev.to/codinsonn/why-use-react-native-over-flutter-a-recap-57b0) on dev.to for our more detailed list of alternatives.

**The main recommendation for a more opinionated, more automated and extensible Universal Expo + Next.js starter to [move fast and build things](https://dev.to/codinsonn/how-to-compete-with-elons-twitter-a-dev-perspective-4j64) will always be FullProduct.dev üëá**

## Level up with [FullProduct.dev](https://fullproduct.dev) ‚ö°Ô∏è

### Git based Plugin Branches

[![Screenshot of list of Plugin Branches](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2d4d836-c2ad-4249-bc53-de2ab7d5aac1)](https://github.com/Aetherspace/universal-app-router/pulls)

**PR & branch based plugins will provide you with the ability to:**  

‚úÖ learn what code and files change together to add a feature  
‚úÖ inspecting the diff that makes it possible  
‚úÖ check-out, test and edit a plugin before merging   

*This universal base starter already has some git-based plugins in the form of mergeable pull-request.*

Needless to say, the FullProduct.dev Universal App starterkit will take this to a next level with plugin branches for:

üîê Universal Auth  
üí∏ Payment systems like Stripe  
‚úâÔ∏è Sending & building emails  
üìö Automagic documentation  
üîå Various database integrations  

On top of so many other options, you'll also be able to move *even faster* thanks to:

üöÄ Codegen & automation so you can focus on business logic  
üìã Way of Working built for copy & pasting entire features across projects  
üí° Innovative way to use Zod as the Single Source of Truth for all data defs
