# Aetherspace Plugin Branches

While you can use any package you want in your Aetherspace monorepo, we've created a few merge ready plugin branches to make the starterkit even more plug & play using git.

Some example use cases:
- Need to provide cross-platform authentication? (e.g. using Clerk) -> `git merge with/clerk-auth`
- Need to convert .svg files into cross-platform Icon components, or use known ones? -> `git merge with/green-stack-icons`
- Need utils to turn your single sources of truth into DB models? (e.g. for Mongoose? -> `git merge with/mongoose`)

Plugins are branches that you can merge (or copy) into your repo, and they'll usually add tools for aetherspace specific ways of working:
- `schemas/` - single sources of truth for the package / solution / plugin (e.g. Clerk auth, Mongoose, ...) and typescript types
- `routes/` - example pages and API routes to integrate the selected solution into your app
- `scripts/` - scripts to generate code from your schemas or assets (e.g. CRUD resolver generators for your DB models)

... as well as `components/`, `hooks/`, `screens/`, `styles/`, `utils/` and more to optimize integrations through:
- âœ… Optimizing for cross-platform (Expo + Next.js) development
- âœ… Integrating with your [Single sources of truth](/packages/@aetherspace/schemas/README.md)
- âœ… Adding code generators to skip manual boilerplate

While generating your repo from there, you can choose to "âœ… include all branches".  
Or, if you've already generated your repo, you can merge in the branches manually.

Either way:

```shell
git merge with/{plugin-name}
```
