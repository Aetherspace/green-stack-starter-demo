## So... why start with a hybrid first approach?

> Consider this clip from the App.js conf intro talk by Charlie Cheever:

<div className="video-container">
    <iframe

        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen

#### The stats don't lie:

- **More and more internet use on mobile** vs. steady decline on desktop
- 90% of that **mobile internet use is coming from apps** vs. mobile browsers
- Yet we seem to **keep focusing on building websites** instead of apps
- Once built, **apps can still benefit from web** (SEO, Discoverability, Landing pages)
- **So why not go full cross platform from the start?**
