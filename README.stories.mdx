  <summary><b>🤔 So... why start with a hybrid first approach?</b></summary>

> Consider this clip from the App.js conf intro talk by Charlie Cheever:

<div className="video-container">
    <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/te7bwfNsRKg?controls=0&amp;start=2641&amp;end=2748"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen

#### The stats don't lie:

- **More and more internet use on mobile** vs. steady decline on desktop
- 90% of that **mobile internet use is coming from apps** vs. mobile browsers
- Mobile **apps drive up to 3x more conversion rates** than browsers (<a href="https://branch.io/journeys/#:~:text=Your%20most%20EFFECTIVE%20conversion%20channel" target="_blank">source</a>)
- Yet we seem to **keep focusing on mostly building websites** instead of apps
- However, **apps can still massively benefit from web** (SEO, Discoverability, Landing pages)
- So... **why _not_ go hybrid with Expo + Next.js** from the get-go?
