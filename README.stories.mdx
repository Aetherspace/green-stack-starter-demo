## So... why start with a hybrid first approach?

> Consider this clip from the App.js conf intro talk by Charlie Cheever:

<div className="video-container">
    <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/te7bwfNsRKg?controls=0&amp;start=2641&amp;end=2748"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
</div>

#### The stats don't lie:

- **More and more internet use on mobile** vs. steady decline on desktop
- 90% of that **mobile internet use is coming from apps** vs. mobile browsers
- Yet we seem to **keep focusing on building websites** instead of apps
- Once built, **apps can still benefit from web** (SEO, Discoverability, Landing pages)
- **So why not go hybrid from the start?**
