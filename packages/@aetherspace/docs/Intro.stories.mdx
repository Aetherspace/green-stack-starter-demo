#### The stats don't lie:

- **More and more internet use on mobile** vs. steady decline on desktop
- 90% of that **mobile internet use is coming from apps** vs. mobile browsers
- Yet we seem to **keep focusing on building websites** instead of apps
- Once we do build an app, chances are likely you'll **still want / need a website** as well
- **So why not go cross platform from the start?**
