# GREEN stack quickstart âš¡

> Welcome! Set up your Web, iOS & Android app in minutes, and blow away the competition with write-once components that run on all platforms. Powered by GraphQL, React, Expo & Next.js

## Web & Mobile with Aetherspace

Generate a new repo from the [Aetherspace template](https://github.com/Aetherspace/green-stack-starter) and optionally include all branches.

Github will then generate a copy of the template repo for you to customize.
It comes out of the box with setup for:

- Next.js web app (File based routing, Serverside rendering, Static site generation, ...)
- Expo mobile app (Android & iOS with react-native)
- A REST & GraphQL API (with Apollo Server & Next.js API routes)
- Documentation for both Aetherspace and the example components
- [Automation](/packages/@registries/README.md) scripts to automatically generate API & component documentation
- Github actions for mobile deployments, linting your code & building your documentation

**When you're ready to start developing, run `yarn install` to install all dependencies, followed by:**

```bash
yarn dev:docs
```
