# Aetherspace GREEN Stack Starter License

Depending on the type of your legal entity and github sponsorship tier, you are granted permission to use Aetherspace for your project. Individuals and small companies are allowed to use the Aetherspace GREEN stack starter to create repositories for projects (even commercial), while a company license is required for for-profit organisations of a certain size. This three-tier system was designed to ensure funding for this project while still allowing the source code to be available at low cost to most and for free to non-profit organisations. Read below for the exact terms of use.

## License FAQ

### Will you ever actually enforce the license in any way?

**As long as you're not using it for any of the disallowed usecases**, I don't care what you do with it or how you got access to it. **I'm not going to sue you or anything.** I just want to make sure that the template repo is not used to somehow (promote) harm (to) others or worsen the climate crisis.

If you have the means, I would appreciate it if you would sponsor me on Github Sponsors, but I'm not going to force you to do so.

### Can I still use Aetherspace if I no longer sponsor the author?

Yes. As long as you paid **at least once** at some point in the past, **you are allowed to keep a copy** of the Aetherspace GREEN-stack template repo (kept "as-is" or customised) and use it for the **allowed usecases**.

However, **you will lose access to the original repo** and any further updates / patches / bugfixes / new features which are added after you've stopped sponsoring.

### Can I use the template repo for free if I include a link to the project or your sponsor page?

Yes. If you keep the disclaimer the README.mdx file comes with, as far as I'm concerned, you're allowed to use the template repo for free. Alternatively, you can include a "Built with Aetherspace" reference in your app linking to the project.

It's not really necessary, but if you'd like official confirmation, you can contact me via **thorr@codinsonn.dev** (or [twitter](https://twitter.com/codinsonn)). I will then evaluate and personally grant you access to the template repo, after which your usecase will officially fall under the eligibility of the 'Free License'.

### Can I instead sponsor the open-source projects, contributors and libraries that Aetherspace is built on in order to get free access?

Yes. You absolutely can.

If I can verify that you have sponsored a related open-source project, contributor or library whose work Aetherspace is built on, contact me and I will grant you free access to the template repo. Your usecase will then fall under the 'Free License' eligibility as I personally granted you access free of charge.

### Are there plans to open-source the template repo at some point? If so, what about licensing?

Yes. This is **intended to be temporary sponsorware**. As soon as a certain sponsorship threshold is reached where I've technically made back the time I invested in the project, I will open-source the template repo. Sponsorships for access and license compliance will then become fully optional for all allowed usecases, but **disallowed usecases will remain in effect**.

I'm not sure when that will be, but I'm working on including a **transparancy section on my [personal website](https://codinsonn.dev)** that will show the current status of the sponsorship threshold, as well as how much gets donated to open-source projects, contributors and libraries that Aetherspace is built on.
