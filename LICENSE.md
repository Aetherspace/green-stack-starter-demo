# Aetherspace GREEN Stack Starter License

Depending on the type of your legal entity and github sponsorship or purchase tier, you are granted permission to use Aetherspace for your project. Individuals and small companies are allowed to use the Aetherspace GREEN stack starter to create repositories for projects (even commercial), while a company license is required for for-profit organisations of a certain size. This three-tier system was designed to ensure funding for this project while still allowing the source code to be available at low cost to most, as well as keep it free for non-profit organisations and non-commercial personal use.  

Read below for the exact terms of use.

Copyright (c) 2024 Thorr Stevens

### Eligibility

You are eligible to use the Aetherspace GREEN stack starter for personal and commercial use if granted access free of charge by the author (Thorr Stevens, a.k.a. [@codinsonn](https://github.com/sponsors/codinsonn)) AND while being any of the following:
- a non-profit or not-for-profit organisation

- evaluating whether the template repo is a good fit, and are not yet using it in a commercial way
- an embassador of the project, linking to Aetherspace or the author in your app and / or README file

### Allowed use cases

Permission is hereby granted, to any person eligible for the "Free", "Personal" or "Commercial" licenses, to use the software non-commercially or commercially for the purpose of creating repositories and kickstarting projects and to modify the software to their own liking, for the purpose of fulfilling their custom use case.

Meaning you can:
- Use the Aetherspace Template, its Utils, APIs, Components or Plugin Branches to create unlimited End Products.
- Modify, expand and personalise the Aetherspace Template, its Utils, APIs, Components or Plugin Branches to create derivative components and templates for internal team use. Though any derivative template repos are also subject to this license.
- Use the Aetherspace Template, its Utils, APIs, Components or Plugin Branches and derivatives to create unlimited End Products for unlimited Clients.
- Use the Aetherspace Template, its Utils, APIs, Components or Plugin Branches and derivatives to create End Products where the End Product is sold to End Users.
- Use the Aetherspace Template, its Utils, APIs, Components or Plugin Branches and derivatives to create End Products that are open source and freely available to End Users. (Excluding public template repositories or publicly published / relicensed reusable UI kits or Design Systems)

Examples of allowed use cases:
- Creating a personal website and/or mobile app.
- Creating a personal project starter kit or template repository for all your (team's) projects.
- Creating a web and/or mobile application for a client that will be owned by that client.
- Creating a commercial SaaS application (like an AI generation app for example) where end users have to pay a fee to use the application.
- Creating a commercial self-hosted web and/or mobile application that is sold to end users for a one-time fee.
- Creating a web and/or mobile application where the primary purpose is clearly not to simply re-distribute the components (like an event or organization app that uses the components for its UI for example) that is free and open source, where the source code is publicly available but not reproducible as it's own template repository.

**In summary, you are allowed to use the Aetherspace Template, its Utils, APIs, Components or Plugin Branches for any purpose, as long as you are not competing with Aetherspace or using it for anything that is illegal or harms others.**

These allowed usecases apply to all licenses, including the personal and commercial licenses.

### Disallowed use cases

It is not allowed to copy or modify Aetherspace code for the purpose of selling, renting, licensing, relicensing, sublicensing your own derivate of the GREEN stack starter template.

Meaning you cannot:
- Use the Aetherspace Template, its Utils, APIs, Components or Plugin Branches to create End Products designed to allow an End User to build their own End Products using the Template code, nor derivatives of the Template, its Utils, APIs, Components or Plugin Branches.
- Re-distribute the Aetherspace Template, its Utils, APIs, Components or Plugin Branches or derivatives of the Aetherspace Template separately from an End Product, neither in code or as design asset.
- Use the Aetherspace Template, its Utils, APIs, Components or Plugin Branches to produce anything that may be deemed by Aetherspace Digital, in their sole and absolute discretion, to be competitive or in conflict with the business of Aetherspace Digital as a provider of premium universal app starter templates and plugin branches.

Examples of disallowed use cases:
- Forking the Aetherspace starter repository as a public template repo published for others to use. (Private internal forks are encouraged instead)
- Creating a publicly available or relicensed UI kit or design system from the Aetherspace components. (Private internal UI kits and design systems are encouraged instead)
- Creating a theme, template, or project starter kit from the Aetherspace GREEN stack starter and making it available either for sale or for free.

**In summary, don't use the Aetherspace Template, its Components or Plugin Branches for competing with Aetherspace as a starter template or use it for anything that is illegal or harms others.**

These disallowed usecases apply to all licenses, including the personal and commercial licenses.

### Enforcement

You are granted only the permissions described in this license's allowed use cases. You will be required to remove any Github projects that fall under the disallowed usecases, or take down any promotional websites advertising your derivative of the Aetherspace Template, its Utils, APIs, Components or Plugin Branches.

## License FAQ

### This is weird, is this some sort of official license?

I based a first draft of this license off of [Remotion](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/blob/main/LICENSE.md)'s custom license and made the rest up as I went along. It's designed to be a low effort, three tiered system that allows for free, small and unlimited commercial use whenever either of those makes sense. I'm not a lawyer, but I'd say it seems fair for every use case.

### Will you ever actually enforce the license in any way?

**As long as you're not using it for any of the disallowed usecases**, I don't care what you do with aetherspace or how you got access to it. **I'm not going to sue you or anything.** I just want to make sure that the template repo is not used to compete with my business or somehow (promote) harm (to) others or earths ecosystems.

If you have the means, I would appreciate it if you would purchase the license and / or sponsor me on Github Sponsors, but I'm not going to force you to do so.

### Can I still use a personal derivative of Aetherspace if I no longer sponsor the author?

Yes. As long as you or your company supported me financially **at least once** at some point in the past, **you are allowed to keep any copies and custom derivatives** of the Aetherspace GREEN-stack template repo and use it for the **allowed usecases** laid out in the license you had initially been eligible for.

However, **you will lose access to the original template repo** and any further updates / patches / bugfixes / new plugin branches or features which are added after you've canceled or stopped sponsoring.

### Can I use the template repo for free if I include a link to the project or your sponsor page?

Yes. If you can include a "Built with Aetherspace" reference in your app linking to the project and author, as far as I'm concerned, you're allowed to use the template repo for free for personal use. Alternatively, you can keep the disclaimer the README.mdx file comes with:

> This project was bootstrapped with the [Aetherspace GREEN stack starter](https://github.com/sponsors/codinsonn), the Evergreen repo setup for all your full-product universal app development needs \{...💚\} Enabling the project to be built for Web, iOS, Android, PWA, Static, SSR, REST and GraphQL all at once 👇 ... while also documenting your code automatically with Storybook.

It's not really necessary, but if you'd like official confirmation, you can contact me via **thorr@codinsonn.dev** (or [twitter](https://twitter.com/codinsonn)). I will then evaluate and personally grant you access to the template repo, after which your usecase will officially fall under the eligibility of the 'Free License'.

This only counts for personal use though. If you're a mid size to larger company, the company will still need to purchase a commercial license.

### Can I instead sponsor the open-source projects, contributors and libraries that Aetherspace is built on in order to get free access?

Yes. You absolutely can.

If I can verify that you have sponsored a related open-source project, contributor or library whose work Aetherspace is built on, contact me and I will grant you free access to the template repo. Your usecase will then fall under the 'Free License' eligibility as I personally granted you access free of charge.

This only counts for personal use though. If you're a mid size to larger company, the company will still need to purchase a commercial license.

### Are there plans to open-source the template repo at some point? If so, what about licensing?

Yes. This is **intended to be temporary sponsorware**. As soon as a certain purchase or sponsorship threshold is reached where I've technically made back the time I invested in the project, I will open-source the template repo. Sponsorships for access and license compliance will then become fully optional for all allowed usecases when it comes to individuals and smaller teams, but mid to large sized companies that can easily affort it will still be encouraged (or even required) to purchase a license. Also, any and all **disallowed usecases will remain in effect**.

I'm not sure when that will be, but I'm working on including a transparancy section on my **[personal website](https://codinsonn.dev)** that will show the current status of the sponsorship threshold, as well as how much gets donated to open-source projects, contributors and libraries that Aetherspace is built on.
